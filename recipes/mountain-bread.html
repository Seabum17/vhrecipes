            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup bread flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus extra to coat bowl</li>
                <li>1 cup bread flour, or more as needed</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                <div>Place 1/2 cup flour, yeast, and sugar in a mixing bowl.  Pour in warm water.  Whisk
                together thoroughly,2 to 3 minutes.  Cover bowl and let sit until mixture gets bubbly,
                30 to 60 minutes.  Drizzle in olive oil; add salt and 1 cup flour.  Mix together until
                mixture forms a sticky dough ball that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
                If mixture seems too wet, add a bit more flour.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                <div>Lightly flour a work surface.  Knead dough until it is soft, supple, and slightly elastic
                about 2 minutes.  Pour a few drops of olive oil in the bowl.  Transfer dough ball to bowl
                and turn to coat surface with oil.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                <div>Cover bowl and place in a warm spot.  let dough rise until it has doubled in size, 60 to
                90 minutes.  Transfer dough to work surface and knead to remove air bubbles, about 1
                minute.  Transfer to zip top plastic bag; refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                <div>Lightly flour a work surface; dough may be sticky so make sure you use enough flour
                to keep dough from sticking to the surface or your hands.  Break
                off a piece of dough slightly smaller than a golf ball.  roll into a smoothh ball.  Flatten
                and roll out into a circle about 1/8-inch thick</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                <div>Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. Flour your hands and carefully remove dough.
                Transfer to hot skillet.  cookuntil blisters form and cover, using dish
                inverted over it to allow bread to steam and stay moist and supple.</div>
